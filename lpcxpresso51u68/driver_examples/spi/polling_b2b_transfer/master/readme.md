Overview
========
The spi_polling_board2board_master example shows how to use spi driver as master to do board to board transfer with 
polling:

In this example, one spi instance as master and another spi instance on othereboard as slave. Master sends a piece of
data to slave, and receive a piece of data from slave. This example checks if the data received from slave is correct.

SDK version
===========
- Version: 2.15.0

Toolchain supported
===================
- MCUXpresso  11.8.0
- GCC ARM Embedded  12.2

Hardware requirements
=====================
- Micro USB cable
- LPCXpresso51U68 board
- Personal Computer

Board settings
==============
Populate jumper JP3.
Connect SPI master on board to SPI slave on other board
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Master - SPI3
Pin Name   Board Location
MISO       J4 pin 3
MOSI       J4 pin 2
SCK        J4 pin 4
PCS2       J4 pin 7
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Prepare the Demo
================
1.  Connect a micro USB cable between the PC host and the CMSIS DAP USB port (J6) on the board
2.  Open a serial terminal with the following settings (See Appendix A in Getting started guide for description how to determine serial port number):
    - 115200 baud rate
    - 8 data bits
    - No parity
    - One stop bit
    - No flow control
3.  Download the program to the target board.
4.  Reset the SoC and run the project.

Running the demo
================
When the demo runs successfully, the log would be seen on the CMSIS DAP terminal like:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Master Start...!

Succeed!
