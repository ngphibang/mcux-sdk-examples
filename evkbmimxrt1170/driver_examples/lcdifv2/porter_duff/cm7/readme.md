Overview
========
This example demonstrates how to use the LCDIF v2 porter duff feature. In this
example, layer 0 and layer 1 are enabled and blended. Layer 0 is destination layer,
shows a red rectangle. Layer 1 is source layer, shows a blue rectangle. The blend
mode changes and the panel shows the different blend result.

SDK version
===========
- Version: 2.15.0

Toolchain supported
===================
- GCC ARM Embedded  12.2
- MCUXpresso  11.8.0

Hardware requirements
=====================
- Mini/micro USB cable
- MIMXRT1170-EVKB board
- Personal Computer
- RK055MHD091 panel or RK055AHD091 panel or RK055IQH091 panel

Board settings
==============
Connect the panel to J48
Connect 5V power to J43, set J38 to 1-2

Prepare the Demo
================
1.  Connect a USB cable between the host PC and the OpenSDA USB port on the target board.
2.  Open a serial terminal with the following settings:
    - 115200 baud rate
    - 8 data bits
    - No parity
    - One stop bit
    - No flow control
3.  Build the project, the project uses RK055MHD091 by default, to use other panels,
    change
    #define USE_MIPI_PANEL MIPI_PANEL_RK055MHD091
    to
    #define USE_MIPI_PANEL MIPI_PANEL_RK055IQH091
    or
    #define USE_MIPI_PANEL MIPI_PANEL_RK055AHD091
    in lcdifv2_support.h.
3.  Download the program to the target board.
4.  Either press the reset button on your board or launch the debugger in your IDE to begin running the demo.
